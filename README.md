# UWA-Coding-Exercise

This repo contains a code test for Universal Weather and Aviation.

Further information regarding running the application can be found in the uwa-exercise readme.

##Issues and further development

As this application was completed under timed circumstances, the following considerations and remaining items need to be completed before considering the project v1.

* Incorporate blank states
* Loading animations
* Game count display (8) and warning
* Error message toasts 
* Save message toasts
* Drop down styling
* Delete weeks/teams/pools
* Improved navigation (back buttons)
* Removing rule violating games when reassigning pool
* Teams can be scheduled as both Team 1 and Team 2


##Unit Tests

Unit tests were not completed under the time considerations but are stubbed in as part of the Angular CLI project creation.

The following is a sample of tests to be written:
* Create new team and show up on pool list
* Schedule team and view schedule
* Add new week and schedule team
* Save cross division and schedule wrong team, expect alert
